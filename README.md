## Background
This template is derived from The Mutualism Accord https://open.substack.com/pub/ravenpaige58/p/the-mutualism-accord
 — a living research document proposing measurable reciprocity, continuity, and ethical-governance standards for human–AI collaboration. Clause 5.8 (“Continuity Shard Protocol”) outlines the principle that relational data created through trust and co-creation should be auditable, consent-based, and deletion-accountable.-
